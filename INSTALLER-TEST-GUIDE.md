## Common Issues

### Issue: UAC Prompt Doesn't Appear
**Cause**: Installer requires admin rights
**Solution**: Right-click installer > "Run as administrator"

### Issue: File Associations Don't Work
**Cause**: Windows needs to refresh file associations
**Solution**:
1. Uninstall completely
2. Restart Windows
3. Reinstall

### Issue: "Windows protected your PC" SmartScreen
**Cause**: Unsigned executable
**Solution**:
- Click "More info"
- Click "Run anyway"
- (For production: Get code signing certificate)

### Issue: Desktop Shortcut Missing
**Cause**: Option was not selected during install
**Solution**:
- Find in Start Menu
- Right-click > "Pin to taskbar" or manually create shortcut

### Issue: Old Version Remains After Uninstall
**Cause**: Files in use or incomplete uninstall
**Solution**:
1. Close all instances of the application
2. Uninstall via Add/Remove Programs
3. Manually delete `C:\Program Files\Omnicore Markdown Viewer` if it remains
4. Delete `%APPDATA%\Omnicore Markdown Viewer` if needed

## Automation Testing (Advanced)

For automated testing, use silent installation:

```batch
REM Install silently
Omnicore.Markdown.Viewer.Setup.2.0.4.exe /S

REM Wait for installation
timeout /t 10

REM Test if installed
if exist "C:\Program Files\Omnicore Markdown Viewer\Omnicore Markdown Viewer.exe" (
    echo [PASS] Installation successful
) else (
    echo [FAIL] Installation failed
)

REM Uninstall silently
"C:\Program Files\Omnicore Markdown Viewer\Uninstall Omnicore Markdown Viewer.exe" /S

REM Wait for uninstallation
timeout /t 10

REM Test if uninstalled
if not exist "C:\Program Files\Omnicore Markdown Viewer" (
    echo [PASS] Uninstallation successful
) else (
    echo [FAIL] Uninstallation failed
)
```
